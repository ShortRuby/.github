## Short Ruby

The purpose of Short Ruby is to help Ruby community grow. 

I plan to do this through 3 main pillars:
- Support Ruby content creators reach a larger audience
- Help builders pick the righ Ruby tool for their job
- Educate newcomers and guide existing members to level up their skills


## Main projects

There are currently two main projects:
- The [Short Ruby Newsletter](https://newsletter.shortruby.com) - a Monday morning summary of the articles, discussions, and news from the Ruby community. I watch a series of places like Twitter, ruby.social, Reddit, Linkedin, Dev.to, Ruby LibHunt, and other news sources.
- The [RubyAndRails.info](https://rubyandrails.info) - a directory of resources about Ruby (books, communities, screencasts, Youtube series, podcasts, newsletters and more)

## Open Source Projects

1. The main ShortRuby.com static website - https://github.com/ShortRuby/shortruby.com
2. The rubyandrails.info - https://github.com/ShortRuby/rubyandrails.info
3. A RSS Filter used to only show the main editions of the newsletter - https://github.com/ShortRuby/rssfilter

If you want to contribute to any of these projects or talk about ideas about how to grow our community we have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eXGHgPwG9x) where we talk about the project.
